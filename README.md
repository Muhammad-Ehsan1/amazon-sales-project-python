# amazon-sales-project
Conducted an end-to-end sales analysis on Amazon's transactional dataset using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, renaming and converting column data types, and dropping irrelevant fields. Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in product size preferences, shipping methods, buyer types (individual vs. B2B), and top customer locations. Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots were used to derive actionable insights and summarize the sales performance across different states and product categories.
